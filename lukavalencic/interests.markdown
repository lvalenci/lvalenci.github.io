## My Interests

Outside of technical work, I love hiking, running, and playing virtually all sports. I also read voraciously outside of term, primarily science fiction and fantasy.

I went hiking in Slovenia's Alps frequently before I graduated high school and they remain my favorite mountains. I've also went hiking in the summers near where I worked and have thus explored the mountains near Los Angeles one year, hiked some 14ers near Denver the next, as well as hiked the hills near Palo Alto and Mount Tam in the summer of 2021.

I currently am not part of any regular sports league, but I do actively participate in Caltech's Interhouse Sports, where different [houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_system_at_the_California_Institute_of_Technology) compete against each other in various sports. Before coming to Caltech, I played on school teams for basketball, cross country, tennis, and track.
