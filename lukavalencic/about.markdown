## Education

I'm currently in my senior year at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) where I'm studying computer science. I've tried to get a broad view of the different aspects of CS during my time at Caltech and have taken advanced courses in networks, robotics, operating systems, databases, and machine learning. 

At Caltech, I am a member of the [Caltech Racing](http://fsae.caltech.edu/) team where we design, build, and race an electric car. On Caltech Racing, I worked as the Electrical Technical lead, making sure that all of the various subsystems would work well together and on various projects related to the low voltage battery and power distribution. 


## Experience
I will be joining Duolingo as a software engineer in the summer of 2022. Prior to that, I have had two internships, one at Tesla and the second one at United Launch Alliance.

At Tesla, I worked on the High Voltage Software Integration Team. There I took on muliple projects including validating firmware to be used in the release of Plaid cars outside of North American markets, redesigning the software architecture for hardware testers, and doing thermal testing on the entire vehicle to help develop a new charging feature.

At United Launch Alliance I worked on the Software Tools team developing an internal web tool which tracked all of the tools used in launch, manufacturing, and design to help the team centralize all information in one place. This helped to reduce tools with duplicate features, ease management of the tools, and ensure that depedencies were accounted for in tool migrations.

## Teaching

At Caltech, I was the teaching assistant (TA) for 3 courses, CS 3: Introduction to Software Engineering (3 times), CS 24: Introduction to Computing Systems, and CS 38: Introduction to Algorithms. CS 3 was the most enjoyable to be a TA for since despite being a large class, I worked with 2 groups of 4 students and advised them throughout the course, let me get to know them and their project quite well. The class was also a project class where the students develop a physic game engine and then used that engine to design their own game, so a small part of my job was playing their games. Since the project was over the course of the entire term, their codebase got rather complicated and by helping them with their issues I became even better at debugging since I wasn't that familar with their code.
